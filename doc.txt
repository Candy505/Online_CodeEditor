1 Wireframing
2 Defining structure of the whole web App
3 Hooks :

The data will change because, in our app, there will be user interaction triggered by the user selecting languages and themes.
To display them properly on the screen, we will need to store them in the state variables.
For that, we will use Reactâ€™s built-in useState Hook, which is a standard way of handling this in the React ecosystem.

There will be three stae variables :
a input
b themes
c language select

4 Components Creation :
  a Dropdown
  b Editor
  c Highlighter

  Dropdown  will have theme and language select

5 Didn't pass theme and language value to state variables so it was showing first default value in the list
